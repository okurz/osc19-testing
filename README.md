# openSUSE testing - an overview

How is software within the openSUSE ecosystem tested? What kind of tests exist? Who is doing what?

This talk will try to present an overview of how "testing" is done for software developed in the openSUSE ecosystem. The workflow of software contributions to the openSUSE distributions will be shown from testing perspective from upstream source code repos to feedback from users in the released products. Used tools will be mentioned, the testing approaches as well as the people involved. The relation to SLE testing will be described. As this "overview" will not be able to cover all approaches used by the community feedback by the audience in the Q&A part of the talk will be appreciated. Of course, openQA will be included but it is certainly not the only solution to be mentioned ;)

Based on reveal.js + openSUSE theme
